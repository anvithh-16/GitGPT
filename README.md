# GitGPT: Natural Language to Git CLI

This tool translates plain English commands into `git` commands, explains them, and offers to execute them for you. It uses the OpenAI API (which now powers models like the one that replaced Codex) to understand your requests.

## Setup Instructions

**1. Clone/Create the Project**

Create the project directory:

Download all the files
Create gitgpt directory and add the files in the gitgpt branch to it
Go to the directory and pip install -e.
Your gitgpt is ready
